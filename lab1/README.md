# Laboratory work 1

## Main information
The goal of the laboratory work is to implement the LU-decomposition of the matrix. It is necessary to implement 4 variants of decomposition and compare calculating time. Implementation options:
* Common LU decomposition
* Block LU decomposition
* Common LU decomposition parallel
* Block LU decomposition parallel
For more detail information about each method check literature/book.pdf
## Results
Here represented time in milliseconds to decompose matrix with different methods
