# Laboratory work 1

## Main information
The goal of the laboratory work is to implement the LU-decomposition of the matrix. It is necessary to implement 4 variants of decomposition and compare calculating time. Implementation options:
* Common LU decomposition
* Block LU decomposition
* Common LU decomposition parallel
* Block LU decomposition parallel
